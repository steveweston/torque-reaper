Proposed requirements for prologue scripts:

Should provide good support for both serial and parallel jobs.

Should be designed to facilitate testing and include a test suite.

Should provide information about the stray processes to aid in
determining the cause of the process becoming a stray, including
information from its process tree and its environment.

Should support a flexible logging mechanism, including support for
syslog and email notification, and allow different logging levels for
different logging handlers.

Should use a configuration file and allow different configuration based
on node and cluster.

Should allow hierarchial configuration to avoid unnecessary replication
of configuration information.

Should support the definition groups of clusters and nodes within
clusters in order to simplify configuration.

Configuration parameters should include:

  - enabled         Flag: Whether to run or not
  - kill            Flag: Whether to kill stray processes or not
  - safeusers       List: Process owners to allow to run outside a job
  - sysloghost      String: Hostname of syslog daemon
  - syslogport      Integer: Port of syslog daemon
  - syslogfacility  String: Syslog facility name to use
  - email           List: Email addresses to notify

The prologue script should be based on code that can be used in
different contexts, including a cron job and an interactive command
utility.

Should support use by a non-root user so users can clean up after
themselves.
